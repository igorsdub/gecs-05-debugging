## Installation

Use the package manager [pixi](https://pixi.sh) to install a virtual enviroemnet for this project.

```bash
pixi install
```

## Usage

To execute the project pipeline via command-line interface (CLI), first active the virtual environement shell

```bash
pixi shell
```

Next, run the following commands in the given order:

```bash
python src/dataset.py main
python src/analysis.py main
python src/plots.py main
```

The word count histogram, `histogram.pdf`, can be found in `results` folder.

For running each of the steps using [Pixi tasks](https://pixi.sh/latest/workspace/advanced_tasks) execute the following:

```bash
pixi run process
pixi run analyze
pixi run plot
```

In order to run all of these tasks together, use a convieniet task that combines the above together:

```bash
pixi run all
```

You might wish to clean the folders before you do so with

```bash
pixi run clean
```

To see how the pipeline has been refactored, you can run the same commands as in the Tutorial 1:

```bash
python src/dataset.py data/raw/book.txt data/processed/book.txt
python count_words.py data/processed/book.txt analyzed/word_count.csv
python plot_histogram.py analyzed/word_count.csv results/histogram.pdf
```

The commands above are scripted versions of src layout run code using [Typer](https://typer.tiangolo.com/).

`notebooks/0.01-igorsdub-generate_book_word_count_histogram.ipynb` contains the whole pipeline from start to finish but without any file saving. `## Local library import` section very well illustractes the power of src layout. You don't need to edit code in the notebook or relaoed it upon every edit of the module.

## Tests

Run tests on the source code to verify correctness of the method.

```bash
pytest --cov
```

`pytest` will automatically find files that start with `test_` across the repository. `--cov` generates a coverage report that shows how much of the source code has been covered by the tests.

Alternatively, you can run a Pixi task:

```bash
pixi run test
```
